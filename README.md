# DNDS6288 - Scientific Python 2024/25 Fall

## Final project: Annual Analysis of Criminal Court Cases in Uzbekistan.
Done by Shohruh Sadullaev.

This project conducts a comprehensive analysis of all criminal cases in Uzbekistan from January 2023 to December 2023. Official website of judiciary system (https://public.sud.uz/report/CRIMINAL) contains over 69,000 public cases from 2023, categorized by court type, instance, relevant article (from criminal code), name of judge, date and region. This analysis will focus on identifying trends in the number of cases over time, exploring regional variations, and examining the types of courts handling these cases. Additionally, I will conduct a detailed breakdown of the most common crime categories, including bribery, theft, fraud, domestic violence and other offences. By using statistical and visual analysis, this project will uncover patterns in the criminal justice system and highlight any significant findings related to case outcomes, crime types, and geographic differences across the country.
